	<h2> Goals For This Semester </h2> 
	<br>
	<p>My goal for this semester is to become more comfortable writing and understanding HTML and CSS. I have never used Javascript before, so I am interested in learning how to use this language to benefit my code. I would also like to be able to recreate my designs for eBlasts and Facebook tabs in HTML and CSS more efficiently. I would also like to better understand how to test my HTML in different web browsers. </p>
